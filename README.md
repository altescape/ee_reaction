EE Reaction
===========

Reaction is a plugin to capture reactions to ExpressionEngine entries
At the moment it's a rough work in progress - but the idea is to have something where users can state their reaction to an entry.

Such as...
STAR, LOVE, SMILE, LOL, POOR

The plugin will count the reactions and store in a database.

TODOS:
------

1. Styles.
2. Add a back end so admins can...
3. ...Add customisable icons and customisable reactions.
4. Record who has 'reacted' and to what and provide reports in backend.
5. Limit users reacting more than once to an entry, but can change their mind.
