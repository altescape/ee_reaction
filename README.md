EE Reaction
===========

***This plugin is not yet ready for production use***

Reaction is a plugin to capture reactions to ExpressionEngine entries
At the moment it's a rough work in progress - but the idea is to have something where users can state their reaction to any kind of channel entry.

So users can state reactions sucg as...
STAR, LOVE, SMILE, LOL, POOR
The plugin will count the reactions and store in a database plus show in front end per entry.

## TODOS:

### Back end
1. Add a back-end :)
2. Add CP page where admins can customise reactions and icons, plus reorder, etc
3. Add CP page that outputs reports and analysis on what has been reacted to and by whom

### Front end
1. Style it so it looks lovely
2. Output the icons and reactions customised in the backend
3. Limit 1 reaction per entry for each user (though users can change reaction)
